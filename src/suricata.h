/** \mainpage Doxygen documentation
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The Suricata Engine is an Open Source Next Generation Intrusion Detection
 * and Prevention Engine. This engine is not intended to just replace or
 * emulate the existing tools in the industry, but will bring new ideas and
 * technologies to the field.
 *
 * \section dev_doc Developer documentation
 *
 * You've reach the automically generated documentation of Suricata. This
 * document contains information about architecture and code structure. It
 * is attended for developers wanting to understand or contribute to Suricata.
 *
 * \subsection modules Modules
 *
 * Documentation is generate from comments placed in all parts of the code.
 * But you will also find some groups describing specific functional parts:
 *  - \ref decode
 *  - \ref httplayer
 *  - \ref sigstate
 *  - \ref threshold
 *
 * \section archi Architecture
 *
 * \subsection datastruct Data structures
 *
 * Regarding matching, there is three main data structures which are:
 *  - ::Packet: Data relative to an individual packet with information about
 *  linked structure such as the ::Flow the ::Packet belongs to.
 *  - ::Flow: Information about a flow for example a TCP session
 *  - ::StreamMsg: structure containing the reassembled data
 *
 *  \subsection runmode Running mode
 *
 *  Suricata is multithreaded and running modes define how the different
 *  threads are working together. You can see util-runmodes.c for example
 *  of running mode.
