 *  \brief Flow data structure.
 *
 *  The flow is a global data structure that is created for new packets of a
 *  flow and then looked up for the following packets of a flow.
 *
 *  Locking
 *
 *  The flow is updated/used by multiple packets at the same time. This is why
 *  there is a flow-mutex. It's a mutex and not a spinlock because some
 *  operations on the flow can be quite expensive, thus spinning would be
 *  too expensive.
 *
 *  The flow "header" (addresses, ports, proto, recursion level) are static
 *  after the initialization and remain read-only throughout the entire live
 *  of a flow. This is why we can access those without protection of the lock.
