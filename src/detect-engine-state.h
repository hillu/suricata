/* On DeState and locking.
 *
 * The DeState is part of a flow, but it can't be protected by the flow lock.
 * Reason is we need to lock the DeState data for an entire detection run,
 * as we're looping through on "continued" detection and rely on only a single
 * detection instance setting it up on first run. We can't keep the entire flow
 * locked during detection for performance reasons, it would slow us down too
 * much.
 *
 * So a new lock was introduced. The only part of the process where we need
 * the flow lock is obviously when we're getting/setting the de_state ptr from
 * to the flow.
