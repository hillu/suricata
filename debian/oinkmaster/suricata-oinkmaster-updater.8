.\" Please adjust this date whenever updating the manpage.

.SH NAME
suricata-oinkmaster-updater \- Run oinkmaster to update suricata ruleset

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B suricatas-oinkmaster-updater

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the \fBsuricatas-oinkmaster-updater\fP
command.
.PP
\fBsuricata-oinkmaster-updater\fP is a shell script that run
\fBoinkmaster(1)\fP to update \fBsuricata(8)\fP ruleset.
The intention is to hook the call to this script from a daily cron job,
so \fBsuricata(8)\fP rulesets are automagically updated every day.

.SH HOW IT WORKS
The default Debian configuration will run \fBoinkmaster(1)\fP with the config
file \fI/etc/suricata/suricata-oinkmaster.conf\fP which is pre-configured to
download the \fPEmergingThreats\fP open ruleset for \fBsuricata(8)\fP.
.PP
When the download is completed, \fBsuricatasc(1)\fP will be called to
instruct \fBsuricata(8)\fP to reload the ruleset.

.SH CONFIGURATION
By now, the only way to modify the behaviour of
\fPsuricata-oinkmaster-updater\fP is to modify the
\fI/etc/suricata/suricata-oinkmaster.conf\fP file. Or modify the shell
script itself.
.PP
More options may be added in the future.
