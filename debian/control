Description: Next Generation Intrusion Detection and Prevention Tool
 Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System (IDS). It is based on
 rules (and is fully compatible with snort rules) to detect a variety of
 attacks / probes by searching packet content.
 .
 This new Engine supports Multi-Threading, Automatic Protocol Detection
 (IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, TLS, FTP and SMB), Gzip Decompression, Fast
 IP Matching and coming soon hardware acceleration on CUDA and OpenCL GPU
 cards.
 .
 This version has inline (NFQUEUE) support enabled.
