Description: Next Generation Intrusion Detection and Prevention Tool
 Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System (IDS). It is based on
 rules (and is fully compatible with snort rules) to detect a variety of
 attacks / probes by searching packet content.
 .
 It can also be used as Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), and as higher layer
 firewall.
 .
 This new Engine supports Multi-Threading, Automatic Protocol Detection
 (IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, TLS, FTP and SMB), Gzip Decompression, Fast
 IP Matching and coming soon hardware acceleration on CUDA and OpenCL GPU
 cards.
 .
 This version has inline (NFQUEUE) support enabled.

Package: suricata-oinkmaster
Architecture: all
Depends: oinkmaster, suricata (>= ${source:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Integration package between suricata and oinkmaster
 Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System (IDS). It is based on
 rules (and is fully compatible with snort rules) to detect a variety of
 attacks / probes by searching packet content.
 .
 This package contains the integration bits between suricata and oinkmaster
 to allow easy automated ruleset updates.

Package: suricata-dbg

Depends: suricata (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Next Generation Intrusion Detection and Prevention Tool - debug symbols
 Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System (IDS). It is based on
 rules (and is fully compatible with snort rules) to detect a variety of
 attacks / probes by searching packet content.
 .

Package: libhtp-0.5.24-1
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Priority: extra
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: HTTP normalizer and parser library
 The HTP Library is an HTTP normalizer and parser.
 This integrates and provides very advanced processing of HTTP streams
 for Suricata.
 .
 The HTP library is required by the suricata engine, but may also be used
 independently in a range of applications and tools.
 .
 This package provides the runtime files for libhtp.

Description: Development files for libhtp
 The HTP Library is an HTTP normalizer and parser.
 This integrates and provides very advanced processing of HTTP streams
 for Suricata.
 .
 The HTP library is required by the suricata engine, but may also be used
 independently in a range of applications and tools.
 .
 This package provides the development files and static libraries.
