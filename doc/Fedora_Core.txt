Fedora Core


pre-installation requirements

Before you can build Suricata for your system, run the following command to
ensure that you have everything you need for the installation.

  sudo yum -y install libpcap libpcap-devel libnet libnet-devel pcre \
  pcre-devel gcc gcc-c++ automake autoconf libtool make libyaml \
  libyaml-devel zlib zlib-devel libcap-ng libcap-ng-devel

Depending on the current status of your system, it may take a while to complete
this process.

HTP

HTP is bundled with Suricata and installed automatically. If you need to
install HTP manually for other reasons, instructions can be found at HTP
library_installation.

IPS

If you plan to build Suricata with IPS capabilities via ./configure --enable-
nfqueue, enter the following:

  sudo yum -y install libnfnetlink libnfnetlink-devel \
  libnetfilter_queue libnetfilter_queue-devel
