DETECTION ENGINE:
- implement flow as a prefilter
- implement protocol as a prefilter
- implement src ports as prefilters
- do a sort-insert for the temp address lists: sort it big to small to speed up later inserts: partly done
- deal with icmp & icmpv6 sigs
- ip only sigs only need to be checked once per flow direction, so put flags in packet to deal with that
- store a ptr to the rule group in the flow (the src,dst,sp,dp,proto will never change in a flow, so we can use that as a starting point)

WU-MANBER:

ADDRESSES:
- support [1.2.3.4,2.3.4.5] notation: unittest

MAIN:
- move packet preallocation into it's own function
- create a cleanup function
- consider a api for per module init/deinit functions per packet, for example to clean up flowvars & http_uri

THREADING
- Add pre-threading initialization API e.g. for Sig loading on Detect.
- Add post-threading deinitialization API

CUSTOM LOGGING:
- idea: add a logging module that can be told to output things based on flowvars
