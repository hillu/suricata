CentOS5


Pre-installation requirements

You will have to use the Fedora EPEL repository for some packages to enable
this repository. It is the same for i386 and x86_64:

  sudo rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-
  5-3.noarch.rpm

Before you can build Suricata for your system, run the following command to
ensure that you have everything you need for the installation.

  sudo yum -y install libpcap libpcap-devel libnet libnet-devel pcre \
  pcre-devel gcc gcc-c++ automake autoconf libtool make libyaml \
  libyaml-devel zlib zlib-devel

Depending on the current status of your system, it may take a while to complete
this process.

HTP

HTP is bundled with Suricata and installed automatically. If you need to
install HTP manually for other reasons, instructions can be found at HTP
library_installation.


IPS


If you plan to build Suricata with IPS capabilities via ./configure --enable-
nfqueue, there are no pre-built packages in the CentOS base or EPEL for
libnfnetlink and libnetfilter_queue. If you wish, you may use the rpms in the
Emerging Threats Cent OS 5 repository:
i386

  sudo rpm -Uvh http://rules.emergingthreatspro.com/projects/emergingrepo/i386/
  libnetfilter_queue-0.0.15-1.i386.rpm \
  http://rules.emergingthreatspro.com/projects/emergingrepo/i386/
  libnetfilter_queue-devel-0.0.15-1.i386.rpm \
  http://rules.emergingthreatspro.com/projects/emergingrepo/i386/libnfnetlink-
  0.0.30-1.i386.rpm \
  http://rules.emergingthreatspro.com/projects/emergingrepo/i386/libnfnetlink-
  devel-0.0.30-1.i386.rpm

x86_64

  sudo rpm -Uvh http://rules.emergingthreatspro.com/projects/emergingrepo/
  x86_64/libnetfilter_queue-0.0.15-1.x86_64.rpm \
  http://rules.emergingthreatspro.com/projects/emergingrepo/x86_64/
  libnetfilter_queue-devel-0.0.15-1.x86_64.rpm \
  http://rules.emergingthreatspro.com/projects/emergingrepo/x86_64/
  libnfnetlink-0.0.30-1.x86_64.rpm \
  http://rules.emergingthreatspro.com/projects/emergingrepo/x86_64/
  libnfnetlink-devel-0.0.30-1.x86_64.rpm
